    "To establish notation for future use, we'll use $x^{(i)}$ to denote the \"input\" variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and $y^{(i)}$ to denote the \"output\" or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). A pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ is called a <b>training example</b>, and the dataset that we'll be using to learn—a list of m training examples $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$; i=1,..., <i>m</i>—is called a training set. Note that the superscript \"(i)\" in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. In this example, X = Y = ℝ."
